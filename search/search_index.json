In 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled racial covenants to be legally unenforceable in the Shelly v. Kraemer decision. Racial covenants continued to be inserted into property records, however, prompting the Minnesota state legislature to outlaw the recording of new racial covenants in 1953.

Since that time, the growing community of GeoBlacklight adopters has introduced new use cases and institutional requirements. This growth brought several challenges to the metadata application schema as it was originally conceived including:</p> <ul> <li>a lack of fields for statements about rights</li> <li>a lack of clarity around how to define relationships between items</li> <li>few options for describing other types of resources, such as scanned maps, collections, and websites</li> <li>mandatory fields that did not have applicable values (i.e. Geometry Type)</li> <li>single-valued fields that could have multiple values (i.e. Language, Publisher)</li> <li>fields with names that were not intuitive for new users</li> </ul> <p>The minimal nature of the original GeoBlacklight schema combined with the growing environment of customized local fields has presented obstacles for new adopters. Instead of being able to rely on the official application schema to meet all or most of their needs, they must develop local solutions. Ultimately, in order to use GeoBlacklight, many adopters implemented custom fields. A review of extant custom fields in 2020 revealed that at least six institutions had added or altered fields in the GeoBlacklight schema. Altogether, over 20 custom fields were in use. The result of these custom fields was metadata that was not fully interoperable across institutions.

Even within these vocabularies, localized spellings and abbreviations will result in considerable variations between institutions. Institutions are encouraged to observe what terms are commonly in use and, at the very least, strive for internal consistency with controlled vocabularies and spellings.
