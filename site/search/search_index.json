Racial covenants were legal clauses embedded in property records that restricted ownership and occupancy of land parcels based on race. These covenants dramatically reshaped the demographic landscape of Hennepin County in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled racial covenants to be legally unenforceable in the Shelly v. Kraemer decision. Racial covenants continued to be inserted into property records, however, prompting the Minnesota state legislature to outlaw the recording of new racial covenants in 1953. The same legislative body made covenants illegal in 1962. The practice was formally ended nationally with the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968.\"\n],\n\"dct_language_sm\": [\n\"eng\"\n],\n\"dct_creator_sm\": [\n\"Ehrman-Solberg, Kevin\",\n\"Petersen, Penny\",\n\"Mills, Marguerite\",\n\"Delegard, Kirsten\",\n\"Mattke, Ryan\"\n],\n\"dct_publisher_sm\": [\n\"University of Minnesota Mapping Prejudice Project\"\n],\n\"schema_provider_s\": \"University of Minnesota\",\n\"gbl_resourceClass_sm\": [\n\"Datasets\",\n\"Web services\"\n],\n\"gbl_resourceType_sm\": [\n\"Polygon data\",\n\"Vector data\"\n],\n\"dcat_theme_sm\": [\n\"Society\"\n],\n\"dcat_keyword_sm\": [\n\"Minneapolis\",\n\"racial covenants\",\n\"segregation\",\n\"redlining\",\n\"real estate\"\n],\n\"dct_temporal_sm\": [\n\"1910-1955\"\n],\n\"dct_issued_s\": \"2020-12\",\n\"gbl_indexYear_im\": [\n\"1910\"\n],\n\"gbl_dateRange_drsim\": [\n\"[1910 TO 1955]\"\n],\n\"dct_spatial_sm\": [\n\"Bloomington, Minnesota\",\n\"Brooklyn Center, Minnesota\",\n\"Brooklyn Park, Minnesota\",\n\"Champlin, Minnesota\",\n\"Crystal, Minnesota\",\n\"Deephaven, Minnesota\",\n\"Eden Prairie, Minnesota\",\n\"Edina, Minnesota\",\n\"Golden Valley, Minnesota\",\n\"Greenwood, Minnesota\",\n\"Hopkins, Minnesota\",\n\"Maple Grove, Minnesota\",\n\"Maple Plain, Minnesota\",\n\"Medina, Minnesota\",\n\"Minneapolis, Minnesota\",\n\"Minnetonka, Minnesota\",\n\"Minnetonka Beach, Minnesota\",\n\"Minnetrista, Minnesota\",\n\"Mound, Minnesota\",\n\"Orono, Minnesota\",\n\"Osseo, Minnesota\",\n\"Plymouth, Minnesota\",\n\"Rays Lynnhurst, Minnesota\",\n\"Richfield, Minnesota\",\n\"Robbinsdale, Minnesota\",\n\"Shorewood, Minnesota\",\n\"St. Anthony, Minnesota\",\n\"St. Louis Park, Minnesota\",\n\"Tonka Bay, Minnesota\",\n\"Wayzata, Minnesota\",\n\"Woodland, Minnesota\",\n\"Hennepin County, Minnesota\",\n\"Minnesota\"\n],\n\"locn_geometry\": \"POLYGON((-93.77 45.24, -93.17 45.24, -93.17 44.78, -93.77 44.78, -93.77 45.24))\",\n\"dcat_bbox\": \"ENVELOPE(-93.77,-93.17,45.24,44.78)\",\n\"dcat_centroid\": \"45.01,-93.47\",\n\"pcdm_memberOf_sm\": [\n\"dc8c18df-7d64-4ff4-a754-d18d0891187d\"\n],\n\"dct_isPartOf_sm\": [\n\"05d-12\",\n\"05d-03\"\n],\n\"dct_rights_sm\": [\n\"Content distributed via the University of Minnesota's Digital Conservancy may be subject to additional license and use restrictions applied by the depositor.\"\n],\n\"dct_license_sm\": [\n\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/\"\n],\n\"dct_accessRights_s\": \"Public\",\n\"dct_format_s\": \"Shapefile\",\n\"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://schema.org/url\\\":\\\"https://doi.org/10.13020/a88t-yb14\\\",\\\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\\\":\\\"https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/217209/Hennepin_County_Racial_Covenants_Codebook.txt\\\",\\\"urn:x-esri:serviceType:ArcGIS#FeatureLayer\\\":\\\"https://services.arcgis.com/8df8p0NlLFEShl0r/ArcGIS/rest/services/Hennepin_County_Racial_Covenants/FeatureServer/0\\\",\\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":[{\\\"label\\\":\\\"covenants shapefile (4.554Mb)\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/217209/Hennepin_County_Racial_Covenants.zip\\\"},{\\\"label\\\":\\\"covenants CSV (9.925Mb)\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/217209/Hennepin_County_Racial_Covenants_Table.csv\\\"}]}\",\n\"id\": \"0455d309-e4e9-473e-8c3f-b42a6a2e16fc\",\n\"dct_identifier_sm\": [\n\"https://doi.org/10.13020/a88t-yb14\"\n],\n\"gbl_mdModified_dt\": \"2022-09-14T20:18:27Z\",\n\"gbl_mdVersion_s\": \"Aardvark\",\n\"b1g_code_s\": \"05d-03\"\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"aardvark-fgdc-iso-crosswalk/","title":"Aardvark to FGDC and ISO","text":"OGM Aardvark FGDC CSDGM ISO 19139 dct_accessRights_s idinfo/acconst MD_DataIdentification/resourceConstraints/MD_LegalConstraints/accessConstraints dct_alternative_sm -

Since that time, the growing community of GeoBlacklight adopters has introduced new use cases and institutional requirements.

Instead of being able to rely on the official application schema to meet all or most of their needs, they must develop local solutions. Ultimately, in order to use GeoBlacklight, many adopters implemented custom fields. A review of extant custom fields in 2020 revealed that at least six institutions had added or altered fields in the GeoBlacklight schema. Altogether, over 20 custom fields were in use. The result of these custom fields was metadata that was not fully interoperable across institutions.

Controlled vocabularies for GIS data have typically been expressed as ISO Topic Categories and localized thesauri, while scanned maps are typically described with Library of Congress Subject Headings. Even within these vocabularies, localized spellings and abbreviations will result in considerable variations between institutions. Institutions are encouraged to observe what terms are commonly in use and, at the very least, strive for internal consistency with controlled vocabularies and spellings. This facilitates easier metadata sharing across projects, such as the repositories in OpenGeoMetadata. Some institutions choose to create custom keyword fields to hold local, unnormalized values.
