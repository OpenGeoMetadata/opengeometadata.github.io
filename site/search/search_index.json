It was intentionally developed with cross-application in mind and can be used to describe geospatial assets of all kinds. It is also the newest metadata application profile schema for GeoBlacklight. Launched in 2021, it replaces the GeoBlacklight metadata schema version 1.0 ( GBL 1.0 ). Compared to GBL 1.0, Aardvark incorporates additional fields for better descriptions of a wider range of resources, as well as syntactical updates in order to improve interoperability between institutions and between schemas. For GeoBlacklight users, it is the recommended schema for installations starting with GeoBlacklight version 4.0. For more information, see the Upgrade Guide. Why is this called Aardvark? \u00b6 The term \u201caardvark\u201d represents a new naming convention to specify metadata schema versions. This convention is intended to reduce confusion between the metadata schema version and GeoBlacklight software versions, which uses numerical-based indicators. Why do we need an updated schema? \u00b6 GeoBlacklight and its original metadata application schema (1.0) are well-suited to describing single layers of GIS data served out as OGC web services and documented with supplemental metadata, such as ISO 19115 (19139). Since that time, the growing community of GeoBlacklight adopters has introduced new use cases and institutional requirements. This growth brought several challenges to the metadata application schema as it was originally conceived including: a lack of fields for statements about rights a lack of clarity around how to define relationships between items few options for describing other types of resources, such as scanned maps, collections, and websites mandatory fields that did not have applicable values (i.e. Geometry Type ) single-valued fields that could have multiple values (i.e. Language , Publisher ) fields with names that were not intuitive for new users The minimal nature of the original GeoBlacklight schema combined with the growing environment of customized local fields has presented obstacles for new adopters. Instead of being able to rely on the official application schema to meet all or most of their needs, they must develop local solutions. Ultimately, in order to use GeoBlacklight, many adopters implemented custom fields. A review of extant custom fields in 2020 revealed that at least six institutions had added or altered fields in the GeoBlacklight schema. Altogether, over 20 custom fields were in use. The result of these custom fields was metadata that was not fully interoperable across institutions. For example, three schools had implemented three different fields for indicating rights or licenses. Who came up with the schema? \u00b6 The GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema Workgroup consisted of 16 people from 12 institutions. The workgroup formed during the Summer Community Sprint in August 2020 and met every three weeks thereafter through January 2021. The group wrapped up after the Winter Community Sprint in February 2021, during which time they consulted with application developers and finalized the recommendations for Aardvark. Workgroup Goals Systematically assess and evaluate the GeoBlacklight Schema 1.0 Develop a new GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema that features: improved interoperability with DCAT and Dublin Core-based schemas new fields for rights new fields for item relations new recommendations for controlled vocabularies and values Develop a new Metadata Application Profile (MAP) for GeoBlacklight Workgroup Constraints & Considerations The GeoBlacklight schema was designed as an application-specific schema purely for discovery. It should not be a replacement for a full-fledged geospatial standard, such as ISO 19139. Elements that drive the functionality of GeoBlacklight should be examined cautiously, as changes to the schema for these elements will require new application development time to implement. New elements that are optional and additive are easier to adopt than ones that are syntactical replacements of existing fields. Although backward compatibility is usually preferred, it may not be possible to accommodate both schemas within a single application. Any breaking changes must be clearly stated and documented.

All previously hardcoded field names were removed in GeoBlacklight version 3.3 (see this pull request for more information). This means that field names are defined in the settings.yml file and can be configured to use Aardvark. However, only the fields in the crosswalk will have display, facet, or other functionality enabled by default in version 3.3. Some of the new fields in Aardvark will be tied to default application functionality beginning with Version 4.0. We plan to include item relation widgets for the new relationships (such as Member Of and Is Version Of ) and reorganize the facets to include the new categories (such as Resource Class and Resource Type).","title":"About OGM Aardvark"},{"location":"about-ogm-aardvark/#about-ogm-aardvark","text":"Details about the OpenGeoMetadata metadata schema, OGM Aardvark Summary based on Dublin Core , with custom elements added for spatial values designed for discovery - to help users find items not designed for complete technical documentation, such as a GIS dataset's processing history includes elements for external links, such as downloads, web services, or supplemental metadata requires records to be formatted as JSON files OGM Aardvark is a discovery metadata schema for geospatial resources.

Workgroup Goals Systematically assess and evaluate the GeoBlacklight Schema 1.0 Develop a new GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema that features: improved interoperability with DCAT and Dublin Core-based schemas new fields for rights new fields for item relations new recommendations for controlled vocabularies and values Develop a new Metadata Application Profile (MAP) for GeoBlacklight Workgroup Constraints & Considerations The GeoBlacklight schema was designed as an application-specific schema purely for discovery. It should not be a replacement for a full-fledged geospatial standard, such as ISO 19139. Elements that drive the functionality of GeoBlacklight should be examined cautiously, as changes to the schema for these elements will require new application development time to implement. New elements that are optional and additive are easier to adopt than ones that are syntactical replacements of existing fields. Although backward compatibility is usually preferred, it may not be possible to accommodate both schemas within a single application. Any breaking changes must be clearly stated and documented.

Depending upon the type of resource and a repository\u2019s chosen workflows, the format of the original metadata may be in different standards or schemas. For resources without metadata or with very minimal metadata \u00b6 Option A: Create metadata in a non-OGM geospatial standard Many repositories begin the workflow by creating metadata for their resources in a geospatial metadata standard other than the OGM schema. In the United States, this standard is likely either the Federal Geographic Data Committee Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata ( FGDC CSDGM ) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 191xx series . The most commonly used tool for creating geospatial metadata is Esri\u2019s ArcCatalog or ArcGIS Pro (version 2.2 and above). These applications create metadata in a proprietary format, called the ArcGIS 1.0 Metadata format, and use built-in XSLs to transform and export this format to FGDC or ISO as XML files. Note that ArcCatalog and ArcGIS Pro are limited in their default capabilities for batch-processing metadata. Option B: Create metadata in the OGM schema directly Other repositories skip Option A and create records directly in the OpenGeoMetadata metadata schema. Although users benefit from the more complete information that can be added to an FGDC or ISO document, these standards are not needed to run GeoBlacklight. These repositories often use a spreadsheet or a Dublin-Core-based metadata editor to create the records. Scripts can be used to convert spreadsheets (in .csv format) to JSON in the OpenGeoMetadata schema. See Workflows and Tools for example scripts. For resources with existing metadata files \u00b6 Researchers and data providers often create geospatial metadata for their datasets, and repositories may only need to validate or augment the existing metadata records. Geospatial data A large amount of publicly available geospatial data does not have ISO or FGDC. However, it often features some kind of discovery metadata schema that is sufficient for creating OpenGeoMetadata schema records. For example, resources from public data portals, such as Socrata or ArcGIS Hub, will have metadata available in the DCAT schema . The metadata catalog for these portals can be accessed by appending \u201c/data.json\u201d to the end of the portal\u2019s base URL. Other data portals may use a custom metadata schema, but most have APIs that can be programmatically parsed to obtain metadata for each record. Scanned maps Scanned maps from library catalogs should have MARC catalog records, and they should be able to supply the repository with metadata in the .MRC or MARC XML file format. Transform metadata to the OGM schema \u00b6 If the metadata records are in a non-OpenGeoMetadata standard, the next step is to convert or transfer information from some or all of the fields to the OpenGeoMetadata schema. The result of this process is one or more JSON files that will be parsed and indexed by Solr. These JSON files will serve as the content to be shown in the GeoBlacklight application. Transformation workflows \u00b6 Most institutions have their own unique set of tools and workflows to perform this transformation. These workflows may differ depending on the type of item to be referenced. In most cases, automation of this process is desired, although it is possible to create the JSON files manually. The process, whether automated or manual, typically involves parsing the existing metadata record, extracting the values from selected fields and inserting the value into a new JSON document under the corresponding OpenGeoMetadata schema field. In most cases the values can simply be copied over as is, although some additional formatting may be necessary. See Workflows and Tools to view custom scripts and tools for additional metadata authoring techniques. Tip The JSON files in the OpenGeoMetadata schema do not need to be stored with the data/items they are referencing. Multiple items can be referenced in a single JSON file. Some fields will contain the same values for each item (e.g. gbl_mdVersion_s ) Example \u00b6 A finished metadata file could look like the following example in ISO 19139 format: The process of transforming metadata from the above formats to the OpenGeoMetadata schema involves mapping or \u201ccrosswalking\u201d fields from one format to another. Example workflow \u00b6 At Stanford, the metadata records are natively authored in ESRI ArcCatalog and then transformed into ISO 19139. The ISO 19139 records are then transformed to MODS for the library catalog and GeoBlacklight for the GeoBlacklight catalog . Stanford University Metadata Workflow Take, for example, the metadata for this layer . It has the ISO 19139 version of the metadata, along with the Feature Catalog (in ISO 19110 ). We also have the transformation into MODS and to GeoBlacklight , as well as a preview image . In some cases, you may even have an HTML version of the metadata for someone to read. Validate the metadata \u00b6 Once the metadata records are in the OpenGeoMetadata format, they should be validated to make sure the fields are correctly formatted. The current version of the schema is available as a JSON-Schema file . This file format provides support for data validation with the JSON Schema Vocabulary . Recommended Method \u00b6 Use GeoCombine , which has a .valid? method that makes using these tools simple.","title":"Creating Metadata"},{"location":"creating-metadata/#creating-metadata","text":"How to create metadata records in the OpenGeoMetadata schema","title":"Creating Metadata"},{"location":"creating-metadata/#create-or-collect-metadata-records","text":"Step 1 of the metadata workflow is to create or collect original metadata for each layer.

It should be globally unique across all institutions, assumed not to be end-user visible Entry Guidelines This is usually in the form of http://institution/id Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"http://purl.stanford.edu/vr593vj7147\" Commentary This field is required, but it is not displayed in the interface. It may be identical to the layer_slug_s field, or it may be related to or derived from the layer_id_s . This value is ideally a persistent identifier or permalink (such as a [PURL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator) or Handle ). Rights \u00b6 Label Rights uri dc_rights_s Required yes Type string Description Signals access in the geoportal and is indicated by a padlock icon. Users need to sign in to download restricted items Entry Guidelines Choose either Public or Restricted Controlled Vocabulary \"Public\" or \"Restricted\" Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"Public\" Commentary This field can be set to \"Public\", which allows users to view and download an item, or \"Restricted\", which requires a user to log in to an authentication service. If there are additional licenses or rights associated with a resource, administrators will have to create a custom field in the local Solr schema. Title \u00b6 Label Title uri dc_title_s Required yes Type string Description The name of the resource Entry Guidelines Titles should include place names and dates when available. Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"Roads: Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2010\" Commentary The title is the most prominent metadata field that users see when browsing or scanning search results. Since many datasets are created with ambiguous or non-unique titles, it may be worth the effort to improve or enhance them. The ideal sequence of a title is something akin to Topic of Layer: Place, Year. Putting the year at the end of a title produces better search results, since titles are left-anchored. Provenance \u00b6 Label Provenance uri dct_provenance_s Required yes Type string Description The name of the institution that holds the resource or acts as the custodian for the metadata record Entry Guidelines The value for this field should be one of the agreed upon shortened names for each institution. This will embed the correct icon into the search results and item pages. Controlled Vocabulary This repository contains the insitutions that have shared icons: https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight-icons Element Set DCMI Metadata Terms Example \"Stanford\" Commentary This field indicates the institution that contributed the resource. The current community of practice is for this field to hold the name of the university or institution that has created the GeoBlacklight metadata record and/or hosts the dataset. Projects are encouraged to submit their institutional icon to the GeoBlacklight Icons repository to display with the resource. Schema Version \u00b6 Label Schema Version uri geoblacklight_version Required yes Type string Description Indicates which version of the GeoBlacklight schema is in use Entry Guidelines Only current value is \"1.0\" Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"1.0\" Commentary \"1.0\" is the current version of the GeoBlacklight schema. Slug \u00b6 Label Slug uri layer_slug_s Required yes Type string Description This is a string appended to the base URL of a GeoBlacklight installation to create a unique landing page for each resource. It is visible to the user and serves the purpose of forming a persistent URL for each catalog item. Entry Guidelines This string must be a globally unique value. The value should be alpha-numeric characters separated by dashes. Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"stanford-andhra-pradesh-village-boundaries\" Commentary The slug makes up the URL for the resource in GeoBlacklight. If having a readable slug is desired, it is common to use the form, institution-keyword1-keyword2 (words or characters are separated by hyphens). Bounding Box \u00b6 Label Bounding Box uri solr_geom Required yes Type string Description The rectangular extents of the resource. Note that this field is indexed as a Solr spatial (RPT) field Entry Guidelines Bounding box of the layer as a ENVELOPE WKT (from the CQL standard) using coordinates in (West, East, North, South) order. The pattern is: ENVELOPE(. ,. ,. ,. ) Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"ENVELOPE(76.76, 84.76, 19.91, 12.62)\" Commentary The rectangular bounding box is to aid searching with the map interface. Although accuracy is encouraged, it may not always be necessary to to have precise bounding coordinates. The field functions to facilitate discovery more than to indicate exact extents. Solr Year \u00b6 Label Solr Year uri solr_year_i Required no Type integer Description A four digit integer representing a year of temporal coverage or date issued for the resource. This field is used to populate the Year facet and the optional Blacklight Range Limit gem Entry Guidelines This field must be an integer. Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"1982\" Commentary This field is a four digit integer that must be inferred by the temporal coverage or date issued of the resource. If a single record spans multiple years, choose the earliest year for the solr_year_i field. Creator \u00b6 Label Creator uri dc_creator_sm Required no Type array Description The person(s) or organization that created the resource Entry Guidelines This may be an individual or an organization. If available, it should match with the Library of Congress Name Authority File. Controlled Vocabulary The suggested controlled vocabulary is the Library of Congress Name Authority File . Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"George Washington\", \"Thomas Jefferson\" Commentary The dc_creator_sm field is best reserved for instances in which an individual person has collected, produced, or generated analyses of data (as opposed to an agency releasing a data product or resource). See also the comments on dc_publisher_sm . Description \u00b6 Label Description uri dc_description_s Required no Type string Description At minimum, this is a reiteration of the title in sentence format. Other relevant information, such as data creation methods, data sources, and special licenses, may also be included. Entry Guidelines This is a plain text field. Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"This polygon shapefile represents boundaries of election districts in New York City. It was harvested from the NYC Open Data Portal.\" Commentary The dc_description_s field is the second most prominent value that users see when search or browsing for items. Although not required, it is strongly recommended. If the description is minimal or lacking, it can be improved by concatenating available metadata fields, such as title, date, format, and place. This is a plain text field, so html code is not supported here unless the application is customized. It is recommended to assume that discovery happens in multiple contexts (i.e., GeoBlacklight metadata may be integrated into other discovery environments), so descriptions should use complete sentences that signpost what the data object is, even though that is evident within GeoBlacklight itself. Format \u00b6 Label Format uri dc_format_s Required yes, if download link is included AND if download URL is configured as a single key:value pair Type string Description This indicates the file format of the data. If a download link is included, this value displays on the item page in the button under the download widget Entry Guidelines Choose from set values (see Format list) Controlled Vocabulary Format Controlled Vocabulary Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"Shapefile\" Commentary The most important thing to remember about the dc_format_s field is that it is required for Download functionality if using a single value string for downloads. (pre-GeoBlacklight version 3.0). See the Multiple Downloads guide for more details Language \u00b6 Label Language uri dc_language_sm Required no Type array Description Indicates the language of the data or map Entry Guidelines Spell out language (in English) instead of using the ISO 639-1 code (e.g.,\u201cFrench\u201d instead of \u201cfra\u201d). Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"English\" Commentary This field is intended to indicate the language of the dataset, map, and/or supporting documentation. The most common practice in this community is to spell the name language out in English (e.g., \"French\"). Publisher \u00b6 Label Publisher uri dc_publisher_s Required no Type array Description The organization that made the original resource available Entry Guidelines This should always be an organization. Controlled Vocabulary The suggested controlled vocabulary is the Library of Congress Name Authority File . Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"ML InfoMap (Firm)\" Commentary The distinction between dc_publisher_s and dc_creator_sm for data is often vague. Publishers should be the administrative body or organization that made the original resource available, regardless of who compiled or produced the data. Source \u00b6 Label Source uri dc_source_sm Required no Type array Description This is used to indicate parent/child relationships between data layers and activates the Data Relations widget in GeoBlacklight Entry Guidelines This is only added to the child records. Enter the layer_slug_s of the parent record(s) into this field. Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"stanford-vr593vj7147\" Commentary The dc_source_sm field exists to indicate parent-child relationships between records. Common uses include: individual sheets within a map series that can point to a Shapefile that serves as an index map, individual Shapefile layers that have been derived from a Geodatabase that can point to the record for the GeoDatabase, or collection-level and related individual layer records. See Using the Data Relations Widget for more information. Subject \u00b6 Label Subject uri dc_subject_sm Required no Type array Description These are theme or topic keywords Entry Guidelines These should be consistent and chosen from a controlled vocabulary. Use sentence style capitalization, where only the first word of a phrase is capitalized. Controlled Vocabulary Recommended thesauri are ISO Topic Categories and Library of Congress Subject Headings. Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"Census\", \"Human settlements\" Commentary This field is indexed as a facet by default for GeoBlacklight applications, and it can become unwieldy when aggregating metadata records from multiple sources. Controlled vocabularies for GIS data have typically been expressed as ISO Topic Categories and localized thesauri, while scanned maps are typically described with Library of Congress Subject Headings. Even within these vocabularies, localized spellings and abbreviations will result in considerable variations between institutions. Institutions are encouraged to observe what terms are commonly in use and, at the very least, strive for internal consistency with controlled vocabularies and spellings. This facilitates easier metadata sharing across projects, such as the repositories in OpenGeoMetadata . Some institutions choose to create custom keyword fields to hold local, unnormalized values. It is recommended not to use Library of Congress Subject Headings to indicate the geography or spatial coverage of a dataset; instead, use the dct_spatial_sm field for this. Type \u00b6 Label Type uri dc_type_s Required no Type string Description This is a general element to indicate the larger genre of the resource Entry Guidelines Choose from Dublin Core Type values Controlled Vocabulary Type Controlled Vocabulary Element Set Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Example \"Dataset\" Commentary The dc_type_s field is optional, but it can be useful for categorizing between datasets, scanned maps, and collections. The GeoBlacklight 1.0 schema observes the Dublin Core controlled vocabulary for Type Is Part Of \u00b6 Label Is Part Of uri dct_isPartOf_sm Required no Type array Description Holding entity for the layer, such as the title of a collection Entry Guidelines Plain text that is indexed in the Collections facet Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set DCMI Metadata Terms Example \"Village Maps of India\" Commentary The dct_isPartOf_sm field is most often used as a way to group collections arbitrarily. Such groupings often have meaning within local institutions and can be shorthand for keeping like items together. For example, the value could mark all of the items in a single data submission, all of the items that pertain to a class that is working with GIS data, or all of the items harvested from a specific Open Data portal. Date Issued \u00b6 Label Date Issued uri dct_issued_s Required no Type string Description This is the publication date for the resource Entry Guidelines Use any date format, such as the XML Schema dateTime format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ) Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set DCMI Metadata Terms Example \"2015-01-01\" Commentary Although the dct_issued_s field is optional, it is often useful when a clear Temporal Coverage value is not present. For example, one may want to preserve a dataset with an uncertain lineage, but there is an indicator on a data portal on the date of last update. References \u00b6 Label References uri dct_references_s Required no Type string Description This element is a hash of key/value pairs for different types of external links. It integrates external services and references using the CatInterOp approach Entry Guidelines See [External References](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/more-about-references Controlled Vocabulary References URIs Element Set DCMI Metadata Terms Example \"dct_references_s\": \"{\\\"http://schema.org/url\\\":\\\"http://purl.stanford.edu/bm662dm5913\\\",\\\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\\\":\\\"http://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:bm662dm5913/data.zip\\\"}\" Commentary All of the external links for the resource are added to the dct_references_s field as a serialized JSON array of key/value pairs. The download key/value pair is unique, because the value can be an array. See this Multiple Downloads guide for more information. Spatial Coverage \u00b6 Label Spatial Coverage uri dct_spatial_sm Required no Type array Description This field is for place name keywords Entry Guidelines Place name text strings should be specified out to the nation level. It is typical for the place name to represent the largest extent the data layer represents. Controlled Vocabulary Recommended thesaurus is GeoNames Element Set DCMI Metadata Terms Example \"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States\" Commentary It is recommended to have at least one place name for each layer that corresponds to the logical extent of the area of that layer. Adding additional place names that fall within the layer should be done only if they are topically relevant to the content of the data. If a long list of place names is desired in the metadata for search purposes, a customized hidden field is recommended. Temporal Coverage \u00b6 Label Temporal Coverage uri dct_temporal_sm Required no Type array Description This represents the \"Ground Condition\" of the resource, meaning the time period data was collected or is intended to represent. Displays on the item page in the Year value Entry Guidelines This is a text string and can indicate uncertainty Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set DCMI Metadata Terms Example \"2007-2009\" Commentary The dct_temporal_sm field is multi-valued, so multiple strings can be used to indicate the time period the resource depicts, when the data was collected, and/or when the resources was created. Examples include: \u201c1910?\u201d, \u201c1800-1805\u201d, \u201cbefore 2000\u201d. If a single dataset spans multiple years, one can add each intervening year as a discrete value (e.g., 2007,2008,2009,2010). However, a common convention is to include only the first and last year (e.g., 2007,2010 for a dataset encompassing the span of time between 2007 and 2010). Geometry Type \u00b6 Label Geometry Type uri layer_geom_type_s Required no Type string Description This element shows up as Data type in GeoBlacklight, and each value has an associated icon Entry Guidelines Choose from set values (see Controlled Vocabulary Lists) Controlled Vocabulary Geometry Type Controlled Vocabulary Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"Polygon\" Commentary This field helps to differentiate between vector (Point, Line, Polygon), raster (Raster, Image), nonspatial formats (table), or a combination (Mixed). If processing metadata from a geospatial web server, this value may be programmatically determined. However, in many cases, it must be manually determined. The field is tied to icons for the resource, and provides the user with visual clues to the item. However, if the element is troublesome or unnecessary for a particular institution, it can be omitted. Layer ID \u00b6 Label Layer ID uri layer_id_s Required no Type string Description Indicates the layer id for any WMS or WFS web services listed in the dct_references_s field Entry Guidelines Only the layer name is added here. The base service endpoint URLs (e.g. \"https://maps-public.geo.nyu.edu/geoserver/sdr/wms\") are added to the dct_references_s field. Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"druid:vr593vj7147\" Commentary The Layer ID is used to point to specific layers within a geospatial web service. This field is not used for ArcGIS Rest Services. Modified Date \u00b6 Label Modified Date uri layer_modified_dt Required no Type date-time Description Last modification date for the metadata record Entry Guidelines Use the XML Schema dateTime format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ) Controlled Vocabulary no Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"2015-01-01T12:00:00Z\" Commentary This value should indicate when the metadata (not the resource itself) was last modified. Suppressed \u00b6 Label Suppressed uri suppressed_b Required no Type boolean Description If set to True, the record will not appear in search results. If is still accessible from the Data Relations widget and via direct URL. Entry Guidelines Values can be True or False Controlled Vocabulary yes Element Set GeoBlacklight Example \"True\" Commentary This field is useful for multipart items with identical metadata, such as pages in an atlas or series.","title":"GBL Metadata Version 1.0"},{"location":"gbl-1.0/#list-of-fields","text":"Label URL Required Recommended Identifier dc_identifier_s X Rights dc_rights_s X Title dc_title_s X Provenance dct_provenance_s X Schema Version geoblacklight_version X Slug layer_slug_s X Bounding Box solr_geom X Solr Year solr_year_i X Creator dc_creator_sm X Description dc_description_s X Format dc_format_s X Language dc_language_sm Publisher dc_publisher_s Source dc_source_sm Subject dc_subject_sm X Type dc_type_s Is Part Of dct_isPartOf_sm Date Issued dct_issued_s References dct_references_s X Spatial Coverage dct_spatial_sm X Temporal Coverage dct_temporal_sm Geometry Type layer_geom_type_s X Layer ID layer_id_s Modified Date layer_modified_dt X Suppressed suppressed_b","title":"List of Fields"},{"location":"gbl-1.0/#details","text":"","title":"Details"},{"location":"legacy-versions/","text":"Previous versions of the OpenGeoMetadata metadata schema.

Follow the steps below to get started. Submit a request to set up a new repository for your organization \u00b6 To get started, identify one member from your institution who will be added to the OpenGeoMetadata organization as an owner. Owners are able to create, enable, and manage rights for their own institution's team (e.g., add collaborators, contributors, and reviewers). Submit a request to join OpenGeoMetadata as an owner by commenting on this issue in our GitHub repo: Add members to OpenGeoMetadata group #8 . Choose a unique namespace for your repository \u00b6 Participating institutions are able to create their own unique namespace. This ensures that each institution maintains and is responsible for unique identifiers that correspond with items or layers in its collection. The most common format is to list the domain (.edu, .org, .uk) and then the institution\u2019s name: edu.institution . An institution using unique identifiers with a linked persistent URL, like ARK , may want to name their repository with a suffix: edu.institution.arks . Institutions or collaborative organizations can also choose to adopt their own name for an OpenGeoMetadata repository: big-ten . Here are some examples of each of the following conventions: * Princeton: edu.princeton.arks * Stanford: edu.stanford.purl * New York University: edu.nyu * Big Ten Academic Alliance: big-ten Select a directory structure for your repository \u00b6 Metadata files in GitHub can be organized within directories (i.e., folders) using various structures. Flat \u00b6 For an organization with a small number of records (e.g., 250 records), a basic, flat directory structure within a repository is acceptable. A separate directory should be created for each layer or item described, then named according to the layer's unique identifier. Each directory should contain the metadata for that layer, in whichever standardized format an institution deems appropriate. The following is an example of one directory per item: layer123/ layer124/ layer125/ Categorical \u00b6 Some institutions may want to organize their records into logical groupings. For example, folders could be named for the Resource Class (i.e., Datasets, Maps), Collection, Date of Accession, or other attribute. With this structure, multiple layer files could be placed in the same directory, providing they have unique filenames. In the following example, an institution has divided records by their collection: Datasets/ Hist_Aerials/ Indexes/ Maps/ State_Fed_Orthoimagery/ Hashed \u00b6 Institutions that have a large number of records (e.g., greater than several thousand) may enhance repository performance by dividing the records into a hashed directory. This involves creating nested subdirectories, typically by using an item\u2019s ID to programmatically name them. In the following example, the item\u2019s ID is on the left and the set of nested folders is on the right: bb338jh0716: bb/338/jh/0716 bb509gh7292: bb/509/gh/7292 bc899yk4538: bc/899/yk/4538 A hashed directory structure makes it easy to include additional materials and documentation related to an individual resource. For example, a directory might contain metadata in multiple geospatial metadata formats, as well as auxiliary files like preview images. See the edu.stanford.purl repository for an example: /bc/899/yk/4538/geoblacklight.json iso19110.xml iso19139.html iso19139.xml mods.xml preview.jpg Institutions may choose to use a combination of structures, such as hashed directories within categorical folders. Determine the file-naming rules for your metadata \u00b6 There are two main approaches to naming metadata files: naming by the item's ID or naming by the file's metadata standard. 1. Naming by item ID \u00b6 Each record has a unique filename based on the item\u2019s ID. This allows multiple records to be stored in the same directory. See the edu.harvard repository for an example: /HGL4/json/CAMBRIDGE09_ADDRESSBLOCKS.json CAMBRIDGE09_ADDRESSPOINTS.json CAMBRIDGE09_BIKEFACILITIES.json CAMBRIDGE09_BIKERACKS.json CAMBRIDGE09_BLOCKGROUPS1990.json CAMBRIDGE09_BLOCKGROUPS2000.json ... 2. Naming by metadata standard \u00b6 All records use the same filename pattern, such as */geoblacklight.json or */fgdc.json . This requires each layer to have its own folder. Optional: layers.json Adopting the file-naming by metadata standard approach can make it difficult for end-users to find the relevant metadata files for an item of interest. Including a layers.json file in the main repository folder allows for easy mapping of layers to their location within an organization's repository (e.g., Layer-Id : Folder ). See the edu.stanford.purl repository for an example: { \"druid:bb338jh0716\": \"bb/338/jh/0716\", \"druid:bb509gh7292\": \"bb/509/gh/7292\", \"druid:bc899yk4538\": \"bc/899/yk/4538\", ... } GeoCombine will harvest all metadata records in an OpenGeoMetadata repository that end with the extension .json , regardless of how the records are structured. The one exception is files named layers.json - this file will be skipped during ingest. Document your repository \u00b6 In order to help other institutions find and use the metadata your institution is contributing, the ReadMe.md file should describe basic information about the repository\u2019s file structure, metadata version and customizations, update frequency, and so on. See the edu.nyu repository for an example. You may use the following template to structure your ReadMe.md : # Repository Title Description and link to your institution\u2019s GeoBlacklight instance. ## File Structure Information about how the repository is structured. ## Our Metadata Information about your metadata: * GeoBlacklight metadata version (1.0 or Aardvark) * Custom fields * Any other metadata formats that are included in the repository (e.g. ISO 19139, ISO 19110, MODS) * How often the repository is updated * How metadata is validated, if applicable ## How to Contribute Contact information; whether or not your repository is open for metadata contributions and enhancements.","title":"Share on OpenGeoMetadata"},{"location":"repositories/#submit-a-request-to-set-up-a-new-repository-for-your-organization","text":"To get started, identify one member from your institution who will be added to the OpenGeoMetadata organization as an owner.

The schema is documented on this Legacy page. OGM Aardvark : The new metadata schema that is compatible with GeoBlacklight version 4.0. GeoBlacklight : When spelled out, GeoBlacklight refers to the application itself , not its namesake legacy metadata schema, GBL 1.0. URI : This is the name we give to the metadata element itself. For example, the URI for the Subject field is dct_subject_sm . Namespace : This is how we signify which family of standards or schemas an element belongs to. For the GeoBlacklight schema, this takes the form of the URI\u2019s prefix. For the URI dct_subject_sm , dct_ is the prefix and signifies that this element is from Dublin Core. Solr field type : This is the suffix appended to the URI and indicates what kind of Solr field should be indexed. For dct_subject_sm , the _sm stands for String Multiple. It indicates that the field type is a string and that it can have multiple values. Value : This is the information that is entered in a field. It may be free text (literal value) or a URI/code (nonliteral value). What are the differences between GBL 1.0 and OGM Aardvark? \u00b6 New elements for rights \u00b6 The new set of rights elements are: Label URI Description and Entry Guidelines Access Rights dct_accessRights_s One of two possible values, \"Public\" or \"Restricted\"; controls whether a user can preview or download an item. This element replaces dc_rights_s . Rights dct_rights_sm Free-text field for generic, catch-all access and usage rights. Can include clickable links. License dct_license_sm Field for one or more URIs. Recommended sources are Creative Commons or Open Data Commons . Rights Holder dct_rightsHolder_sm Free-text field for the person or organization owning or managing rights over the resource. New elements for item relations \u00b6 The new schema includes seven relationship fields. The value for each field should be the ID (slug) of the related item. GeoBlacklight version 3.4 and earlier has an Item Relations widget that displays items identified in the Source field. Beginning with version 4, this has been updated to use the same widget for each of these fields The new set of relationship elements are: Label URI Description and Entry Guidelines Source dct_source_sm For items that have been derived from another item (e.g. a digitized shapefile from a historical map). Is Part Of dct_isPartOf_sm For items that are a subset of another item (e.g. a page in a book). This value type is changing from free-text in Version 1.0 to an ID (slug) in the new schema. Member Of pcdm_memberOf_sm For items in a collection. Replaces dct_replaces_sm To refer to an item that has been deprecated. Is Replaced By dct_isReplacedBy_sm To point the user to a new item. Version dct_isVersionOf_sm To indicate that an item is part of a series of resources that are updated or altered. Relation dct_relation_sm For a general purpose relation. Consistent namespaces for all metadata element URIs \u00b6 OGM Aardvark gives preference to elements found in established schemas over custom fields. dct_ : This signifies that the field is part of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms . Any Dublin Core fields from GBL 1.0 were updated to use the dct_ namespace, instead of dc_ . dcat_ : This signifies that the field is from the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) Version 2 . pcdm_ : This refers to the Portland Common Data Model , which is a framework for many digital repository systems. We drew from it to establish one of the item relationship fields. gbl_ : This stands for GeoBlacklight and is used for any field that is application-specific or has no analogous term in other schemas. Multivalued elements whenever possible \u00b6 The original schema features several descriptive metadata fields that only accept one value. The new schema expands many of these to multiple. This changes the URI suffix from _s to _sm . Although it will not affect the GeoBlacklight functionality, this practice may conflict with indexing, as Solr will treat dct_publisher_s as a different field than dct_publisher_sm . Crosswalks \u00b6 Elements without a crosswalk \u00b6 Most of the elements from GBL 1.0 can be crosswalked directly into OGM Aardvark. The values for these elements are the same - only the URI name has changed or the field has been converted to an array. However, there are three elements in GBL 1.0 that do not directly translate into OGM Aardvark. While they have been replaced with similar fields in OGM Aardvark, the values themselves would need to be altered during crosswalking. Type (dc_type_s) * GBL 1.0 Description: This single-valued GBL 1.0 field observes the Dublin Core controlled vocabulary for Type, including Dataset, Image, Collection, Interactive Resource, or Physical Object. * Similar Aardvark element: This has been replaced in Aardvark with the multi-valued Resource Class , which uses a custom controlled vocabulary of Collections, Datasets, Imagery, Maps, Web services, and/or Other. Geometry Type (layer_geom_type_s) * GBL 1.0 Description: This single-valued GBL 1.0 field differentiates between vector (Point, Line, Polygon), raster (Raster, Image), non-spatial formats (Table), or a combination (Mixed). * Similar Aardvark element: This has been replaced in Aardvark with the multi-valued Resource Type , which uses a controlled vocabulary drawn from Library of Congress cartographic genres and GIS geometries. Is Part Of (dct_isPartOf_sm) * GBL 1.0 Description: This multi-valued GBL 1.0 plain text field is for writing out the name of a collection. Example: dct_isPartOf_sm:\"Village Maps of India\" * Similar Aardvark element: The URI is the same in Aardvark, but it is now a non-literal field. The value must be one or more IDs that reference another record within the system. Example: dct_isPartOf_sm:\"princeton-z603r079s\" Tools and techniques for upgrading \u00b6 The following options are three ways to upgrade GBL 1.0 metadata into OGM Aardvark. The figures include references to Solr, the search index that powers a GeoBlacklight instance. Option 1: Re-run the metadata pipeline with a new crosswalk \u00b6 Fig.1 - Metadata pipeline showing a conversion from standards metadata Scenario you have geospatial resources with structured metadata files in an official standard, such as ISO 19139, FGDC, MODS, or MARC your organization already has a metadata pipeline process that converts these structured files to GBL 1.0 How does it work? This option involves updating your local transformation workflow that extracts values from standards-based metadata files. For institutions that utilize an XSLT for the transformation, GeoCombine repository has XSL files . For institutions that use custom tools or Python scripts, refer to the OGM Aardvark - FGDC- ISO 19139 crosswalk document to update the code. It shows crosswalks between OGM Aardvark, GBL 1.0, FGDC, and ISO. Considerations for Option #1 may require extra institutional support, particularly if the transformation process is part of a larger framework or connected to a repository. community-developed XSLs are still a work in progress Option 2: Programmatically convert the JSON files \u00b6 Fig.2 - Programmatic transformation process using Geoblacklight 1.0 Metadata JSONs Scenario * you only have GBL 1.0 metadata (no structured metadata files in an official standard) * you want to test your environment with the new Aardvark schema How does it work? Gather GBL 1.0 metadata JSON files on your desktop Use a script or tool to convert the files batch convert GBL 1.0 JSON files to OGM Aardvark Re-index the resulting Aardvark JSON files into your application (GeoBlacklight) Currently, the OpenGeoMetadata community has two tools that can do batch conversions: gbl2aardvark : A web-hosted interface (recommended tool). Users can upload GBL 1.0 metadata files to this tool and it will return a downloadable JSON in the OGM Aardvark schema. In addition to direct crosswalks, this tool will also populate the Resource Class and Resource Type based upon the Type and Geometry Type fields from version 1.0. It will also generate new collection level records based upon the value in the Is Part Of fields. Any fields that do not properly convert will be flagged with the phrase \"EDIT ME --\" When reindexing Solr with a single JSON file representing multiple records, use Solr's \"Document Type\"=\"File Upload\" option. See the GitHub documentation for more information a standalone Python script: https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/gbl-1_to_aardvark . This command line script will perform a straight conversion of field names. It features an editable crosswalk file to customize the transformation. The non-crosswalkable elements listed above (Type, Geometry Type, and Is Part Of) do not have direct crosswalks and will be copied as is into the new Aardvark JSONs. Considerations for Option #2 the fastest method, but is not a long-term solution and may result in incomplete metadata will not include some fields that are new in OGM Aardvark, such as Rights or License. To take advantage of those fields, use Option 1 or 3. Option 3: Conversion with manual remediation \u00b6 Fig.3 - Transformation process that includes manual remediation Scenario you have GBL 1.0 metadata files you want to minimize data loss and corrupted output values you have staff time available for manual work How does it work? This technique combines automatic conversions and manual edits: Convert your GBL 1.0 metadata files to a CSV. This Python script will convert a batch of JSONs to a CSV file Manually augment and adjust column names and values using spreadsheet functions. Convert your spreadsheet to OGM Aardvark JSONs. This Python script will convert CSVs to Aardvark JSONS Considerations for Option #3 more likely to produce normalized, consistent values than Options 1 or 2. may require extra dedicated staff time could be adjusted to work with the extracted metadata from standards files","title":"Upgrading to OGM Aardvark"},{"location":"upgrading/#upgrade-guide-for-converting-metadata-from-gbl-10-to-ogm-aardvark","text":"Terminology used on this page GBL 1.0 : The legacy metadata schema designed for GeoBlacklight versions 2.0-3.7.

For example, the URI for the Subject field is dct_subject_sm . Namespace : This is how we signify which family of standards or schemas an element belongs to. For the GeoBlacklight schema, this takes the form of the URI\u2019s prefix. For the URI dct_subject_sm , dct_ is the prefix and signifies that this element is from Dublin Core. Solr field type : This is the suffix appended to the URI and indicates what kind of Solr field should be indexed. For dct_subject_sm , the _sm stands for String Multiple.
