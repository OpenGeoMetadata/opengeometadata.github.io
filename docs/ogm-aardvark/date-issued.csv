Field Name,dct_issued_s
Field Type,String
Obligation,Optional

Purpose,"To provide the user with the date when an item was published, and to allow administrators to determine the age of the resource."
Entry Guidelines,"A single year is the preferred format. For more precise dates, use the ISO format without the time value: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM."
Commentary,"Although the field is optional, it is often useful when a clear [Temporal Coverage](../ogm-aardvark/#temporal-coverage) value is not present. For example, one may want to preserve a dataset with an uncertain lineage, but there is an indicator on a data portal on the date of last update. In most cases, the 4-digit year is sufficient."
Controlled Vocabulary,No
Example Value,"""1999"""
