Commentary,"The value of this field will appear in Geoblacklight's URL for the item.  It is visible to the user and is used to create permalinks.  Although it may be possible to use other non-Latin or punctuation characters, this is not recommended, as these characters may get percent-escaped in the URLs, or even lead to broken links or other problems.  Since it is common to include records from other institutions, it is recommended that any records you create are prefixed with the short form of your institution's name to avoid collisions with records from other providers."
