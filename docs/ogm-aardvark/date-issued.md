# Date Issued

| Label                 | Date Issued |
|:----------------------|:------------|
| URI                   | `dct_issued_s` |
| Obligation            | Optional |
| Multivalued           | false |
| Field type            | string |
| Purpose               | To provide the user with the date when an item was published, and for administrators to determine the age of the resource |
| Entry Guidelines      | A single year is the preferred format. For more precise dates, use the ISO format without the time value: YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM. |
| Commentary            | Although the field is optional, it is often useful when a clear [Temporal Coverage](temporal-coverage.md) value is not present. For example, one may want to preserve a dataset with an uncertain lineage, but there is an indicator on a data portal on the date of last update. In most cases, the 4-digit year is sufficient. |
| Controlled Vocabulary | no |
| Example value         | `"1999"` |
| Element Set           | DCMI |
| Group                 | Temporal |
