# About Our Schema

Overview of the OpenGeoMetadata metadata schema
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The OpenGeoMetadata schema, [OGM Aardvark](../current-schema/ogm-aardvark), was launched in 2021. It significantly expands upon the community's first metadata schema, [GBL 1.0](../legacy-versions/gbl-1.0). It was intentionally developed with cross-application in mind and can be used to describe geospatial assets of all kinds.

The pages in this section provide an overview of how the OGM schema is structured, what the field elements mean, and how the "References" element works to point users to other source locations.
