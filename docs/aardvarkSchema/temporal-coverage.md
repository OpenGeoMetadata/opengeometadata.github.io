| Purpose               | To provide the user with a free text description of the time period or ranges of what is depicted in the resource                                                                                                                                        |
| Entry Guidelines      | This is a text string and can indicate uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Commentary            | Since this field is multi-valued, multiple strings can be used to indicate the time period the resource depicts, when the data was collected, and/or when the resources was created. Examples include: “approximately 1910”, “1800-1805”, “before 2000”. |
