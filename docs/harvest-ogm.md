Metadata in OpenGeoMetadata can be freely harvested and ingested into other discovery applications. 


## Suffixes

Altering suffixes can result in metadata schema incompatibilities across institutions. Any deviations in element names causes Solr to treat the elements as separate fields: for example `dct_subject_s` and `dct_subject_sm` would be stored separately. If GeoBlacklight is set up to display a facet for `dct_subject_s`, it will not pick up values stored in `dct_subject_sm` in the filter. Therefore, if you are gathering metadata from other institutions, make sure to inspect their metadata fields to determine if there will be inconsistencies in your Solr index.
