# About Our Schemas

Overview of the metadata schemas developed for OpenGeoMetadata
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

OGM Aardvark was launched in 2021, significantly expanding upon the community's first metadata schema, GBL 1.0. It was intentionally developed with cross-application in mind and can be used to describe geospatial assets of all kinds. OGM Aardvark is the recommended schema for GeoBlacklight installations starting with version 4.0.
