| Commentary            | The title is the most prominent metadata field that users see when browsing or scanning search results. Since many datasets are created with ambiguous or non-unique titles, it may be worth the effort to improve or enhance them. The ideal sequence of a title is something akin to Topic of Layer: Place, Year. Putting the year at the end of a title produces better search results, since titles are left-anchored. |
