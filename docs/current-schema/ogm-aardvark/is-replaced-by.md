| Commentary            | [Replaces](https://opengeometadata.github.io/docs/aardvarkSchema/replaces) and **Is Replaced By** can be used for a revised version of a research dataset where the original is needed for reference. For example, if the original dataset has already been cited somewhere, it can be retained in a repository with a clear indication that it has been superseded by a new version. |
