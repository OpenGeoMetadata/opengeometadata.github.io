### 2024

**[OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark: A New Geospatial Metadata Application Profile](https://doi.org/10.1080/15420353.2024.2389278)**  
Majewicz, Karen, Rebecca Seifried, and Susan Powell (2024).  "OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark: A New Geospatial Metadata Application Profile." *Journal of Map & Geography Libraries* 1-25. https://doi.org/10.1080/15420353.2024.2389278  
Preprint version: https://hdl.handle.net/11299/264949
:    An introduction OpenGeoMetadata (OGM) Aardvark. It reviews how OGM Aardvark came to be, from its inception in 2014 as the “GeoBlacklight metadata schema” (GBL 1.0) to its current expanded form, and how it compares to other common metadata frameworks, such as MARC, DCAT, or ISO. Examples from GeoBlacklight instances demonstrate how OGM Aardvark enables patrons to discover geospatial resources.

### 2023
