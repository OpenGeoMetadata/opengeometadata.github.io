## About

This site contains documentation about OpenGeoMetadata schemas and repositories.

## Platform

### Written in: [Markdown language](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a lightweight and easy-to-use language for text documents.
Most text editors support it and translates easily to other formats, such as HTML or PDF or EPUB.

### Generated with: [MkDocs framework ](https://www.mkdocs.org)

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) is a static site generator platform that allows users to create and maintain documentation websites. It takes Markdown files and uses the [Python-Markdown library](https://python-markdown.github.io) to convert the documents to HTML.

### Styled with: [Material for MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

[Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is the most actively developed theme available for MkDocs (as of 2023) and features flexible navigation and many plugins to extend what we can do with Markdown. It is called "Material" because it is based on Google's Material Design guidelines, a web accessibility and screen responsiveness.


### Published with: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free static site hosting service offered by GitHub. It is often used to host documentation sites, personal portfolios, and project websites.
